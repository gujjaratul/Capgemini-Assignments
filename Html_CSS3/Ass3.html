            Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit:केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST:Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit.
            "Temple of the lord of the field"), is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to Shiva.
             Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located 
             in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is 
             open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and
              November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) 
              from Kedarnath temple is carried down to Ukhimath and where the deity is worshiped for
               the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of
                Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.

            The Alaknanda is a Himalayan river in the Indian state of Uttarakhand and one of the two
             headstreams of the Ganges, the major river of Northern India and the holy river of Hinduism.
              In hydrology, the Alaknanda is considered the source stream of the Ganges on account of its
               greater length and discharge however, in Hindu mythology and culture, the other headstream,
                the Bhagirathi, is considered the source stream.
