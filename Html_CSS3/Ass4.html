                The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things” or objects—that are
                 embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting
                  and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet

                Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially 
                data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
                The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

                The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.
                Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from
                 central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge
                  server.

                Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses 
                if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models
